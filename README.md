# JWST-Website
Based on what I've learned so far in HTML and CSS, I created a basic landing page for The James Webb-Space Telescope.  One link under the "Find Out More" button leads to the NASA website which has a lot more information about JWST. The newsletter isn't an actual newsletter. It's just a simple sign up page I was able to create using mailchimp.
